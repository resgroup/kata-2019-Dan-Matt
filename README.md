 Code Kata session - trying to solve the Berlin Clock problem
 
 Tried Object Calisthenics https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ubLKjUnaSGU5AtJNntm0jUkLNU8DLSuFe47k60KY8ws/view

Concepts
Use only one level of indentation per method - stuck to
Don’t use the else keyword - changed original code to meet
Wrap all primitives and strings - next time need to set up classes, currently several strings and primitives
Use only one dot per line - 
Don’t abbreviate
Keep all entities small
Don’t use any classes with more than two instance variables
Use first-class collections
Don’t use any getters / setters / properties
